@Current
Track Repo:
☐ Create "Track Repos" or something dynamic to more easily deal with things like: facing, states, etc.
	☐ facing: 90, 180, 270, 360
	☐ states: normal, moving, attacking, casting, damaged
Key Navigation:
☐ When navigating with the KEYS, favor the facing direction UNLESS the next velocity_direction === -direction
	☐ Align facing movement with Sprites
	☐ 3/4 velocity possibilities continue the *current* until (OR):
		☐ The next node-center is reached
			☐ Update facing after
		☐ A 180-degree velocity is applied
			☐ Update facing after
"Image Not Found":
☐ Create a "no sprite" sprite as a catch-all for any sprite that doesn't exist
	☐ Maybe create a "Debugger" that records all this kind of stuff to a file for remediation
